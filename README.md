### Description

This will get the statistics of your code, from how many forms/modules you have to the amount of If statements in your program. It's handy for getting a breakdown on the complexity of your code (and for showing off about how big your program is :) Let me know if you have any ideas for improvements, and as always, votes are definatly appreciated ;)
